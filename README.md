# eCommerceMarketplace
This is an eCommerce marketplace platform with multiple sellers and buyers. The project is called FullCashback as the main idea of the project was to give up to 100% cashback to users who purchased a product on Amazon and wrote a review. As a result, users would receive a product for free or at a discount and sellers would receive reviews and more traffic to their products. 

The project is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL database. I used PHPMyAdmin to control the database and I used Bootstrap CSS framework.
